This is my first Odin's project and the assignment is to create a webpage that looks similar to Google's homepage, using HTML and CSS knowledge. 

Now that I finished the project, I have a better understanding about HTML and CSS coding, I've learnt how to position and align elements, how to create forms and add styles.
